## 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to **explain to anyone**, without using Google:

### 🧩 General

* What are **nested loops** and how to use them
* What is a **function** and how to use functions
* The **difference between a declaration and a definition** of a function
* What is a **prototype**
* The **scope of variables**
* What the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89` mean
* What are **header files** and how to use them with `#include`
