## 💡 Introduction

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevent it from running correctly.

As you grow as a programmer and software engineer, you’ll learn to use advanced debugging tools like **gdb** or built-in debuggers in IDEs.
However, it’s essential to first master the **core concepts and manual techniques** of debugging — being able to think through your code logically is one of the most powerful skills you can develop. 🧩
